# lyft_to_rosbag
An ros_package to convert the lyft dataset to rosbag format.

I'm still working on it, so feel free to improve or revize the code.

### lyft_to_rosbag.cpp
It contains all sensors' information, includes 7 cameras, 1 or 3 lidars, 3-D annotations and their tf.
### lyft_to_rosbag_raw.cpp
It contains all sensors' information but without 3-D annotation, includes 7 cameras, 1 or 3 lidars and their tf.
